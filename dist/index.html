            Wealthy entrepreneur Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson lead a
            double life: they are actually crime fighting duo Batman and Robin.
            A secret Batpole in the Wayne mansion leads to the Batcave, where
            Police Commissioner Gordon often calls with the latest emergency
            threatening Gotham City. Racing to the scene of the crime in the
            Batmobile, Batman and Robin must (with the help of their trusty
            Bat-utility-belt) thwart the efforts of a variety of master
            criminals, including Catwoman, Egghead, The Joker, King Tut, The
            Penguin, and The Riddler.
